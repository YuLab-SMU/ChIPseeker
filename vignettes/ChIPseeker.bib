	abstract = {Summary: Disease ontology ({DO}) annotates human genes in the context of disease. {DO} is important annotation in translating molecular findings from high-throughput data to clinical relevance. {DOSE} is an R package providing semantic similarity computations among {DO} terms and genes which allows biologists to explore the similarities of diseases and of gene functions in disease perspective. Enrichment analyses including hypergeometric model and gene set enrichment analysis are also implemented to support discovering disease associations of high-throughput biological data. This allows biologists to verify disease relevance in a biological experiment and identify unexpected disease associations. Comparison among gene clusters is also supported.

	abstract = {Androgen receptor ({AR)} is overexpressed in the majority of castration-resistant prostate cancers ({CRPCs).} Our goal was to study the effect of {AR} overexpression on the chromatin binding of the receptor and to identify {AR} target genes that may be important in the emergence of {CRPC.} We have established two sublines of {LNCaP} prostate cancer ({PC)} cell line, one overexpressing {AR} 2-3-fold and the other 4-5-fold compared with the control cells. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation ({ChIP)} and deep-sequencing (seq) to identify {AR-binding} sites ({ARBSs).} We found that the number of {ARBSs} and the {AR-binding} strength were positively associated with the level of {AR} when cells were stimulated with low concentrations of androgens. In cells overexpressing {AR}, the chromatin binding of the receptor took place in 100-fold lower concentration of the ligand than in control cells. We confirmed the association of {AR} level and chromatin binding in two {PC} xenografts, one containing {AR} gene amplification with high {AR} expression, and the other with low expression. By combining the {ChIP-seq} and expression profiling, we identified {AR} target genes that are upregulated in {PC.} Of them, the expression of {ZWINT}, {SKP2} (S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (p45)) and {FEN1} (flap structure-specific endonuclease 1) was demonstrated to be increased in {CRPC}, while the expression of {SNAI2} was decreased in both {PC} and {CRPC.} {FEN1} protein expression was also associated with poor prognosis in prostatectomy-treated patients. Finally, the knock-down of {FEN1} with small interfering {RNA} inhibited the growth of {LNCaP} cells. Our data demonstrate that the overexpression of {AR} sensitizes the receptor binding to chromatin, thus, explaining how {AR} signaling pathway is reactivated in {CRPC} cells.},

	volume = {15},
	issn = {1465-6914},
	doi = {10.1186/gb-2014-15-2-r23},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Polycomb group proteins form multicomponent complexes that are important for establishing lineage-specific patterns of gene expression. Mammalian cells encode multiple permutations of the prototypic Polycomb repressive complex 1 ({PRC1)} with little evidence for functional specialization. An aim of this study is to determine whether the multiple orthologs that are co-expressed in human fibroblasts act on different target genes and whether their genomic location changes during cellular senescence.
{RESULTS:} Deep sequencing of chromatin immunoprecipitated with antibodies against {CBX6}, {CBX7}, {CBX8}, {RING1} and {RING2} reveals that the orthologs co-localize at multiple sites. {PCR-based} validation at representative loci suggests that a further six {PRC1} proteins have similar binding patterns. Importantly, sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation with antibodies against different orthologs implies that multiple variants of {PRC1} associate with the same {DNA.} At many loci, the binding profiles have a distinctive architecture that is preserved in two different types of fibroblast. Conversely, there are several hundred loci at which {PRC1} binding is cell type-specific and, contrary to expectations, the presence of {PRC1} does not necessarily equate with transcriptional silencing. Interestingly, the {PRC1} binding profiles are preserved in senescent cells despite changes in gene expression.
{CONCLUSIONS:} The multiple permutations of {PRC1} in human fibroblasts congregate at common rather than specific sites in the genome and with overlapping but distinctive binding profiles in different fibroblasts. The data imply that the effects of {PRC1} complexes on gene expression are more subtle than simply repressing the loci at which they bind.},
